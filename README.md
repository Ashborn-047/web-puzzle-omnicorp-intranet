> **STATUS: ACTIVE SESSION**

## 👁️ The Simulation
You are a behavioral probe—though you might think you are a temporary auditor. Your journey through OmniCorp is a series of "Acts" designed to test the limits of your curiosity and compliance.

### Act I: Normality
The audit is the filter. Perform routine tasks, flag "structuring" patterns, and realize that competence is just the first layer of the experiment.

## 🚀 Key Features
- **Immersive Interface**: A fully functional React-based intranet including Dashboard, Messages, Directory, and a custom Sys Terminal.
- **Narrative Depth**: Built on a solid foundation of "Bureaucratic Horror" where violence is enacted through policy and process.
- **Dynamic Access Control**: A multi-tiered clearance system (EXTERNAL → L1 → L2 → L3 → OMEGA) that shifts your reality as your position changes.
- **System Triggers**: Contextual notifications and environmental storytelling that react to your investigative patterns.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Framework**: [React 19](https://react.dev/) + [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
- **Styling**: [Tailwind CSS v4](https://tailwindcss.com/) (Atomic Utility Engine)
- **Icons**: [Lucide React](https://lucide.dev/)
- **State**: React Context (Behavioral Tracking & Game State)
