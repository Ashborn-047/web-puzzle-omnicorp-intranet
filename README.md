# Web Puzzle: OmniCorp Intranet 🧩

A narrative-driven, corporate portal puzzle framework. Players navigate a realistic internal network, uncover systemic discrepancies, and escalate access to expose hidden conspiracies.

## 🚀 Experience the Puzzle
- **Realistic Interface**: A fully functional React-based intranet with Dashboard, Messages, Directory, and a custom Sys Terminal.
- **Narrative Depth**: Over 30 files of lore, character profiles, and environmental storytelling.
- **Complexity**: Multiple clearance levels (EXTERNAL → L1 → L3 → OMEGA), department-based access control, and behavioral triggers.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Framework**: React 18 + Vite
- **Styling**: Vanilla CSS with Tailwind-like utility patterns
- **State**: React Context (Behavior Tracking) & Hooks
- **Icons**: Lucide React

## 🧩 Gameplay Mechanics
- **Financial Audit**: Flag suspicious "structuring" patterns under the $5,000 threshold.
- **Terminal Operations**: Use SSH and session hijacking as a SysAdmin.
- **Secure Vaults**: Unlock redacted archives using hidden clues and PIDs.
- **Containment Protocol**: Collect Alpha, Beta, and Gamma keys to trigger the finale.
