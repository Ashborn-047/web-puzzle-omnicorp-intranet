[OMNICORP FACILITY USAGE - SL-4]
[SYSTEM GENERATED REPORT]

NODE STATUS:
Node 001: 42% Load
Node 002: 38% Load
Node 666: [OVERFLOW]

THERMAL ANOMALY:
Heat signature in Node 666 is inconsistent with server hardware.
Patterns match biological decomposition / rapid cellular synthesis.
Fan speeds at 100%.

POWER CONSUMPTION:
Surge detected in Sector 7.
Power from main grid is being diverted to Apex Sol. substation.

STAFF DENSITY:
Human presence in Sector 7: 0
Active session density: 442 (REMOVED IDs)

CONCLUSION:
The correlation is complete.
The hardware is redundant.
The biological substrate is the new network.
